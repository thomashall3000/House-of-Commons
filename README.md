# House-of-Commons
Overview: The House of Commons System is a Python program that allows you to access specific data from the House of Commons database in a convenient and intuitive form. It provides details on MPs, Voting data, Demographics, has a saving data function and even lets you search for specific data within the database.

Features: The primary interface allows for easy access to the rest of the functions and is the first thing you are greeted with when you start the program, it has 5 different available functions: Find my MP, Demographics, Search, Vote Data and Save Data.

The Find my MP function allows users to search for their MP by providing them with questions about which region they're from and which constituency they're from in order. This allows the program to analyse the data and produce the MP's Name, Gender, First Party and Second Party. It then allows the user to search for another MP or to return to the main menu.

The Demographics function allows the user to search for specific demographics in the database, specifically Gender, First Party, Second Party, Country and Region and provides information for each one that is searched. It then gives the user the option to search again or return to the main menu

The Search function allows the user to search for specific date in the database, specifically MPs, Constituencies and Regions. If the user searches for an MP's first name it provides the user with every MP by that name and gives them the option of searching by any particular one. Once the user has chosen it provides the information on the MP and allows the user to decide if they want to save that data into a class or not. The user can also search by constituency name to find information on that and by region name to find information on the region. It then gives the user the option to search again or return to the main menu

The Vote Data function allows the user to search by a constituency's name and then provides voting analytics on it. It then gives the user the option to search again or return to the main menu.

The final function is the Save Data function, which is linked to the MP class and takes data provided by the MP search function to save data to the system. The data can then be retrieved whenever the user wishes to view it again. It then gives the user the option to search for save data again or return to the main menu.
